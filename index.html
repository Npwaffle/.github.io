                <p>
                    Upon skimming through the comprehensive charts, I returned back to sections I found of particular interest and
                    followed the pathing and looked at the sub-topics for each node a little more closely. Having done a little bit
                    of self-taught HTML and CSS in the week prior to starting this class I found myself incredibly interested in the 
                    topics I hadnt touched yet. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example: In the Front-end chart, the first node is "Internet" and the sub-topics of the node can be summarized as 
                    "learn basic internet jargon" and "learn simple internet concepts". However I disagree that someone should immediately
                    familiarize themselves with subjects such as DNS and how it works before going any further; unless its saying to just
                    learn what DNS means, in which case I believe that to be fine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Otherwise, I agree with the flow charts, to the degree that I can ascertain their correctness/relativity to my own experience
                    and I feel that they serve as a good predictor for the topics we should cover, either in class or personally, if we want
                    to enter into the related fields. I also feel that the ordering for the most part is fine.

                <h3>Reading 2:</h3>
                <!--Linking to Reading 2; target attribute set to _blank makes it open a new tab-->
                <a class="link" href="https://medium.com/coderbyte/a-guide-to-becoming-a-full-stack-developer-in-2017-5c3c08a1600c" target=_blank>A Guide to becoming a Full Stack Developer in 2017</a>
                <p>
                    Unlike the first reading (Reading 1, see above), this reading comes in the form of a blog/article post and it takes a more verbose
                    approach to informing the user as to what topics they should learn/master if they wish to pursue the full-stack position.
                    Once again, I agree with most of the contents present and also agree with the order that the contents are displayed for the most part,
                    however version control such as Git should be introduced sooner as version control is omni-present in any computer science field and very important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This article can effectively be summarized to be a series of categorized topic lists, with a little bit more introduction for each category
                    and a little bit more explanation going into each sub-topic compared to the flowcharts of Reading 1. That being said, because it is more
                    verbose it is simultaneously less comprehensive. The flow-chart listed practically every topic under the sun with a little bit more specificity
                    but less information per topic; whereas this article is a little less comprehensive but a fair bit more descriptive. Overall, I would recommend
                    Reading 2 to someone who is looking to get their foot in the door learning the material, someone who might not know as much about the field; while
                    I would recommend Reading 1 more to someone looking to build a comprehensive topic checklist.
                </p>
                <h3>Final Word on the Readings</h3>
                <p>
                    For the most part, I can say the subjects of both readings were well-presented, personally I liked the flow-chart more because flow-charts done well,
                    like Reading 1's, are very nice and easy to follow and can convey more information with fewer words than articles like Reading 2. However, I felt
                    Reading 2 to be a much better and more narrow introduction to the field and knowledge expectations.

                <h2>My Experience with HTML/CSS/JavaScript</h2>
                <p>
                    I just wanted to take the time to add some commentary on my experience working with these 3 pieces of web design. As far as 
                    experience goes, I dont really have too much, this is my first time actually trying to make an index page that is more than
                    just some nonsense typed out while following a tutorial. I started my self-teaching about 3/4ths of the way through
                    August. I spent a fair bit of this summer trying to expand my knowledge with various languages, GML, Java, Python, and C# were some
                    of my focuses. I started the process of learning HTML/CSS/Java by watching 3 videos on YouTube, the youtube channel Traversy Media
                    had 3 Crash Course videos which I watched in the order of HTML -> CSS -> JavaScript. Each video was ~1-2 hours long, the process
                    itself taking longer if you typed-along like I did for the most part.
                </p>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    After these 3 videos, of which the JavaScript one was the only one I stopped most of the way through (because its rather simple
                    content for anyone familiar with programming, though it is still useful to learn the semantics), I then proceeded to go through
                    the first 1/4th of a course on Udemy which re-iterated a bit more indepth on the contents of the 3 above videos in the first 1/4th.
                    I will likely continue to use the course on Udemy to self-teach the content as supplemental reading alongside the course itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am looking towards a fun year, especially since the assignments in this class will give me a target product to work towards while
                    learning the subject. Ultimately, im not sure if I am seeking to really break into the web-dev field and I moreso pursued these topics
                    purely out of interest and a desire to be qualified to add "Front End Web Dev" to the list of entry-level job titles I can apply for 
                    as I pursue jobs throughout this semester. This is my last semester at Lowell and I am hoping to make it a good one.
                </p>

                    As an extra, feel free to use the navbar if you want to see a little bit about my pets, as my pets are a big part of my life and always will be
                    treated like family. Hopefully all of this is substantial enough to satisfy the requirements of homework 1.
