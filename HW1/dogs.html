                    Scout was the longest-lived dog in our family, and definitely the most cherished animal I believe our family ever had and ever will own.
                    He was a hulking behemoth of a Black Lab, the largest our vet had ever seen. He had streaks of rebelliousness interspersed with deeply ingrained
                    fierce loyalty and unconditional love for the family. We got him early on in Austin, Texas, as a very young puppy when he was no larger than the size of
                    his head as an adult. Initially his name was Batman, but we quickly changed that on the car ride home. Scout had an amazing personality and 
                    many quirks that made him unique as a dog, it would be impossible for me to tell his history in this site nor can I possibly convey the complexity
                    that was Scout. One quirk that he had until the end of his days was his excitement for food; whenever it was feeding time he would get so excited
                    with anticipation that he would jump up and down, a 100+ pound black lab even in his arthritic old age would still raise himself up onto his hind
                    legs like a bucking bull repeatedly for food. The food was never anything special either, he would always be excited though even for plain old kibble.

                    About mid-way through our stint in Texas, we got a second Black Lab named <a href="#maggie">Maggie</a>. She and Scout got along famously, though 
                    less so in a romantic way and moreso in a competitive yet-equal members of the pack. They never had any romantic interests as far as we could tell,
                    but they were almost always together and got along very well. Though there was always the expectation where if one got pet, so did the other.

                    Scout, in his twilight years, could best be described as a crotchety old 'man' with a heart of gold. He was always reluctant to be around
                    smaller dogs, but he warmed up really well to Zoey after an initial period of giving her the cold shoulder. The two became best friends until
                    the end.

                <p>
                    Unlike Scout, who wasnt the least bit toy motivated, Maggie was a toy fiend. She absolutely loved playing fetch with tennis balls and had a 
                    love for rope toys. We got Maggie about half-way through our time in Austin, she was about 4-5 years old when we got her from a friend of my mom's 
                    friend. We quickly learned that she had expectations, and a ceaseless desire to play fetch. Maggie was just as deeply loved as Scout, though outside
                    of toys she could be considered a much more neutral kind of dog as far as quirks and personality goes. She was always laid back, desired constant
                    attention like any other dog, loved going on slow walks, and she was very kind and would never pull on the leash. When we got Zoey, Initially
                    Maggie really liked Zoey, kind of like how a mom would like their kid, but very quickly Maggie got tired of the uppity and playful puppy and thats
                    when Scout took over being Zoey's BFF. In the time when Maggie and Zoey were around, Maggie would always play with Zoey by slamming her hind quarters
                    into Zoey whenever Zoey got too playful, and sometimes Maggie would bat at her with her front paw. There was never a meanness to the contact between
                    the two, but there definitely was a stubborn old dog who didnt want to play and an energetic puppy who wanted to play.

                    Zoey is considered to be "my dog" in the family, she is the first dog that can be considered such. She and I have a very strong bond, such that when
                    I went to college down in Texas (Texas State University San Marcos), she became immeasurably depressed and lethargic. We got her as a pup, like
                    most of our other dogs, and she came with more than her fair share of health problems initially, but with a little bit of love, care, and surgery
                    everything was sorted out right as rain. As a puppy, she was naughty and energetic, initially her and Maggie got along famously while Scout was something 
                    of a threat; however this dynamic switched after about a week and Scout warmed right up to Zoey. With the loss of Scout and Maggie, Zoey and Benji were left
                    as the family's new generation of dogs; they have a very interesting dynamic. Zoey doesnt really care too much for Benji and his ironically high amounts of 
                    energy as a puppy; she for the larger part of their co-existence was a reclusive force to be reckoned with and she had very little patience or mercy for benji's
                    antics. It took a while, but she warmed up to him and though she sounds like a violent deathmachine, she does play with him now; though she wears out quickly.
                    Zoey's forms of play with Benji often involve chasing him around the yard in brief spurts of energy followed by rough-housing where she abuses her muscle advantage
                    and her ~10-20 pound advantage. These days Zoey is much calmer, much more sedentary and low energy, though she does still play with Benji she often prefers to spend her
                    time on a chair or sofa or bed, with her preferred room being the sun room where she can gaze into the arboretum and bark at people on the trail. Its always funny to see
                    her display sparks of her inner puppy when Benji isnt around, sometimes in the early morning or late evening after bringing her inside, she will grab a ball or bone 
                    and bounce around much the same way Scout did when it was dinner time. This is made all the more funny by the fact that Zoey abhors toys and never has played fetch or tug-of-war.

                    Benji can best be described as a pint-sized hypoallergenic ball of fluff and energy who channels Maggie's love for toys and fetch but to the 10th degree.
                    He is an unquestionably intelligent, sensitive, and assertive dog filled with undying love for everything and everyone. Any chance he can get, any millimeter of wiggleroom he can get, 
                    if it means he thinks a ball will get thrown then he will demand a ball gets thrown. Such that he will repeatedly kick his feet in anticipation while making cute whining noises.
                    He can smell his toys, he is like the dog-toy terminator where if a toy exists he will find it, even if the toy is hidden or impossibly disguised or masked. He knows when a new toy enters the house
                    even if he cannot see it. He is like a shark but if instead of sharks sensing blood they could sense dog toys. Everyone loves Benji, except Zoey, Zoey tolerates Benji's existence.
                    Benji's sensitivity doesnt stop with toys though, if someone in the house sneezes he will bolt towards them from anywhere in the house to anywhere in the house, with concern and loyalty in his eyes, 
                    and he will jump up on that person and attempt to lick them to make the sneeze better. Why he does this is one of the great mysteries of the universe, and the answer will forever be unknown.

                <h3 class="petSpecies">Mixed Black Lab</h3>
                <p>
                    Sadly, I do not have a picture of Rosco; he was the first dog that I remember, knowing my family had one other dog while I was a baby.
                    My family got Rosco as a pup while we lived in Birmingham, Michigan. Sadly, Rosco's time with us was short-lived; we had him boarded with my grandparents
                    in Tennessee while my family was undergoing a long move process with a temporary layover in a no-dogs-allowed apartment. During this period
                    of time, Rosco managed to get out several times and ran about with the other dogs my grandparents owned. In one such outing Rosco had an unfortunately
                    fatal incident involving a semi-truck on a rural highway. The 3rd grade me at the time was devastated. While Rosco was a short-lived addition to my family, 
                    he was beloved nonetheless, hence why I feel he deserves a spot on this list.
